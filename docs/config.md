# Configuration

The default location for the configuration file is operating system dependent. YAML and TOML are supported.

- On macOS, it is located at `~/.config/distillery.yaml`
- On Linux, it is located at `~/.config/distillery.yaml`.
- On Windows, it is located at `%APPDATA%\distillery.yaml`

The configuration file is optional. If it is not found, the default configuration is used.
