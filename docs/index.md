# Distillery

## Overview

Without a doubt, [homebrew](https://brew.sh) has had a major impact on the macOS ecosystem. It has made it easy to
install software and keep it up to date. However, it is not without its flaws. It has been around for 15 years and
while it has evolved over time, its core technology hasn't changed, and 15 year is an eternity in the tech world.

The goal of this project is to leverage the collective power of all the developers out there that are using tools like
[goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) and [cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist) and many others to
pre-compile their software and put their binaries up on GitHub or GitLab and install the binaries.
